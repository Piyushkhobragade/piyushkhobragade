## Piyush Khobragade

DevOps Engineer focused on building and operating reliable cloud infrastructure with an emphasis on automation, security, and maintainability.

### What I work on
- AWS cloud infrastructure managed through Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions with OIDC-based authentication
- Kubernetes-based systems with attention to scheduling, logging, and observability
- Linux environments used in production-style workflows

### Open source
- Merged contributor to Kubernetes SIG projects (kubernetes-sigs/kueue)
- Experience working with maintainer reviews, CI validation, and incremental improvements
- Contributions focused on correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability

### How I approach engineering
- Prefer simple, auditable solutions over complex abstractions
- Design systems with least-privilege and security-by-default principles
- Optimize for reliability, debuggability, and clear operational behavior

### Current direction
- Improving secure delivery pipelines and cloud infrastructure patterns
- Deepening practical experience with Kubernetes internals and observability
